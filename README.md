A robust, scalable, and flexible architecture for developing RESTful APIs with Laravel using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.

## Introduction

Laravel is an excellent framework for building Powerfull Apps, offering a rich set of features and a clean syntax. However, as projects grow in complexity, it's easy for the codebase to become unmanageable. The absence of a clear architectural pattern can lead to a mix of responsibilities, making the code harder to maintain and scale.

This repository presents a way to structure Laravel projects using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, allowing for better organization, scalability, and separation of concerns. The approach showcased here is inspired by best practices and aims to solve real-world challenges in a practical and maintainable way.

The goal is to provide a solid foundation for building Laravel applications that are.

-   🧩 Easy to Understand. A well-organized codebase with clear boundaries.
-   🛠️ Maintainable. Follow DDD principles to keep concerns separated.
-   📈 Scalable. Designed to grow with your application's needs.
-   🔒 Secure. Focused on applying security best practices.
-   🔥 Performant. Built with performance considerations from the ground up.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This template is designed with flexibility and scalability in mind, but it's essential to understand that every project is unique. Before adopting this template, consider the specific requirements of your project. You may need to modify certain aspects to fit your needs. This template serves as a solid starting point, but it's not a one-size-fits-all solution.

## Key Features
