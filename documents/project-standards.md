# ‚öôÔ∏è Project Standards

Enforcing project standards is critical for maintaining code quality, consistency, and scalability in the development of a RESTful API using Laravel, particularly when applying Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. By establishing and adhering to a set of best practices, developers can ensure that the codebase remains clean, organized, and easy to maintain.

#### PSR-12 Coding Standards

Adopting the [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) coding standard ensures that the codebase is consistent and adheres to widely accepted best practices. PSR-12 extends the PSR-1 coding style guide and provides a set of guidelines for formatting PHP code, including rules for indentation, line length, and use of whitespace. Integrating PSR-12 into the project guarantees that the code is uniform, readable, and follows industry standards.

#### PHPStan

[PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/) is a static analysis tool for PHP that helps identify potential errors in the code before they become issues in production. By analyzing the codebase without actually executing it, PHPStan detects undefined variables, incorrect method signatures, and other common pitfalls. Incorporating PHPStan into the development process ensures that the code adheres to the defined type constraints and best practices, leading to a more robust and error-free application.

#### PHP-CS-Fixer

[PHP-CS-Fixer](https://cs.symfony.com/) is a tool for automatically fixing PHP coding standards issues. It helps maintain consistency by ensuring that the code follows the project's coding standards, such as PSR-12. Configuring PHP-CS-Fixer to run on code before commits ensures that any formatting issues are addressed automatically, allowing developers to focus on functionality rather than formatting.

#### Larastan

[Larastan](https://github.com/nunomaduro/larastan) extends PHPStan for Laravel projects, providing additional rules and checks specific to Laravel applications. It helps catch bugs related to Laravel's dynamic features, such as Eloquent models, service container bindings, and routes. By integrating Larastan, developers can enhance static analysis and ensure their Laravel application adheres to best practices and avoids common mistakes.

#### Rector

[Rector](https://getrector.org/) is a tool for automated refactoring and upgrading PHP code. It allows developers to apply best practices, fix deprecated code, and upgrade to new PHP versions automatically. Using Rector ensures that the codebase stays up-to-date with the latest PHP standards and reduces the risk of introducing bugs during manual refactoring.

#### Testing

Testing is a cornerstone of maintaining a reliable and robust application. Adopting a testing strategy that includes unit tests, feature tests, and integration tests ensures that all aspects of the application are thoroughly tested. Using PHPUnit and Laravel's testing utilities, developers can write tests that cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the application's correctness and stability as it evolves.

-   üß™ Unit Tests. Focus on individual components of the application, ensuring they work as expected in isolation.
-   üöÄ Feature Tests. Test the interaction between different parts of the application, verifying that features work as intended.
-   üîó Integration Tests. Ensure that the application integrates correctly with external services and systems.

#### Pre-Commit Hooks with Husky

[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) is used to manage Git hooks, allowing you to enforce code quality checks before commits are made. By configuring Husky to run linters, formatters, and tests before code is committed, developers can prevent bad code from entering the repository, ensuring that only well-formatted and tested code is committed.

#### Version Control

Maintaining a clean and structured Git history is essential for collaboration and project management. Adopting a version control strategy, such as GitFlow or trunk-based development, helps organize the codebase and manage releases effectively. Additionally, using meaningful commit messages and tags ensures that the history is easy to understand and navigate.

#### Documentation

Good documentation is essential for maintaining a scalable and maintainable codebase. Ensure that every feature, function, and component is well-documented, following the documentation style guide provided. Keeping documentation up-to-date is crucial, as it serves as the primary resource for developers to understand and work with the codebase.
